<h1 align="center">The Tortoise And The Bird</h1>
<img align="right" src="tb.JPEG" width="200px" height="200px">
<p>A tortoise was resting under a tree, on which a bird had built its nest. The tortoise spoke to the bird mockingly, "What a shabby home you have! It is made of broken twings, it has no roof, and looks crude. What's worse is that you had to build it yourself. I think my house, which is my shell, is much better than your pathetic nest".</p>
<p>"Yes, it is made of broken sticks, looks shabby and is open to the elements of nature. It is crude, but I built it, and I like it."</p>

<p>"I guess it's just like any other nest, but not better than mine", said the tortoise. "You must be jealous of my shell, though."</p>
<p>"On the contrary",the bird replied. "My home has space for my family and friends; your shell cannot accommodate anyone other than you. Maybe you have a better house. But I have a better home", said the bird happily.</p>
